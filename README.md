# Comparing Hardware Prefetching Schemes on an L2 Cache   

This is the work of four student in the course TDT4260 at NTNU.

We have implemented three different prefetchers for use with m5 simulator.
We ran the prefetchers using the m5 simulator and compared them on selected programs from the SPEC2000 benchmark.  

## Running
The m5 simulator will typically look for a "prefetcher.cc". Copy either of rpt/dcpt/pdfcm to execute them.
If you want the compile script, feel free to open an issue or contact us :)  

## Notes
Our benchmark was executed using **only** the L2 cache with 8 KB of memory.
